# Gradio PyVis Demo

Live demo on HuggingFace Spaces: https://huggingface.co/spaces/kraussian/gradio-pyvis-demo

This is a simple demo of how a PyVis graph can be integrated into a Gradio UI.

It showcases the following features:

1) Corporate branding at top-left corner. This can be replaced with your own logo image (PNG/SVG/etc)
2) Dataframe displaying all nodes and connections in a tabular format
3) Graphical representation of the network graph

TODO:

* A dropdown was added as Gradio Dataframe does not have an event listener returning the row/cell the user has clicked
